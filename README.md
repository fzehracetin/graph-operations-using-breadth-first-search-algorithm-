# Graph Processing Using Breadth First Search Algorithm

This is term project for a course that I took in fourth semester in university.
**In this program we have a file called kelime.txt and we are trying to make processes using it. The processes that we are make is listed below.**

**1.** Make an adjacency matrix from words in file. 

**2.** Look for adjacency between two words.

**3.** For a given two words if there is transformation between them show it step by step. In every step, only one charachter can change. 

### Example:
  
  ##### **first word:** phone
  
  ##### **second word:** green 

This is transformation between them :  

**_phone ->shone ->shine ->chine ->chink ->chick ->check ->cheek ->creek ->creed ->greed ->green_**

In every step only one character changed.
