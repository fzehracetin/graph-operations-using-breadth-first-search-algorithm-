# Graph Processing Using Breadth First Search Algorithm

In this program we have a file called kelime.txt and we are trying to make processes using it.

**1-** Make an adjacency matrix. 

**2-** Look for adjacency between two words.

**3-** For a given two words if there is transformation between them show it step by step. In every step, only one charachter can change. 

**Example:**
  
  **first word:** phone
  
  **second word:** green 

This is transformation between them :  

*phone ->shone ->shine ->chine ->chink ->chick ->check ->cheek ->creek ->creed ->greed ->green*

In every step only one character changed.
